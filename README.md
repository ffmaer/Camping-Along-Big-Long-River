Camping along Big Long River
============================
We develop an agent-based model for the Big Long River management to plan the schedule of river trips. In our model, we construct artificial intelligent agents with dynamic probability algorithms to simulate the complex human-environment interactions. The criteria for an optimal schedule are high river carrying capacity and minimum visitor encounters. With Monte Carlo annealing, we then construct an evaluation function to select the optimal scheduling plan. Computer simulation shows that our model fits the criteria, stable within the constraints, and is flexible and adaptable for simulating dynamic system.
